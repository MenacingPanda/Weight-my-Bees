# Weight-my-Bees
Beehive weight measuring LabVIEW software developed for the NI myRIO

The software was developed using LabVIEW 2017 Full Development System.
The development target is the NI myRIO 1900, which is running the 2017 software package. 

The main vi is RT Standalone. The FPGA Control.vi must be compiled in order to run RT Standalone.vi
